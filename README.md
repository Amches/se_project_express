# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Features

- User Management: Create and manage user profiles.
- Clothing Management: Customize your wardrobe by adding new clothing items, retrieve items, delete items from the database. Like and dislike items.
- Error Handling: Error messages and validation if something goes wrong with the request. It will return an appropriate message, along with the corresponding error code.

## Technologies Used

- NodeJS: A powerful runtime environment that enables you to run JavaScript code on the server side, outside of the browser
- ExpressJS: A framework that provides the essential tools for building and managing APIs
- Mongo DB: A NoSQL database used to store user data and clothing preferences
- REST API: A design pattern for APIs that utilizes HTTP requests to interact with and manipulate data
- Postman: A tool that allows you to test, document, and share on APIs efficiently

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
